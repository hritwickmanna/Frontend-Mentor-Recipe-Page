## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge was to build out a static recipe page and get it looking as close to the provided design as possible.

### What I Built

I created a clean, semantic HTML5 structure for the recipe content and styled it using CSS3. This project demonstrates my ability to accurately translate a design into code, paying close attention to typography, layout, and spacing.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Semantic HTML5:** The page is structured with semantic tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` for better accessibility and SEO.
* **Custom Fonts:** Integrates Google Fonts (`Young Serif` and `Outfit`) for precise typography matching the design.
* **Styled Lists & Tables:** Demonstrates custom styling for unordered lists (using `list-style-type: square;`) and ordered lists (using the `::marker` pseudo-element).
* **CSS Layout:** Uses CSS Flexbox for the main page container layout.
* **Clean Structure:** Well-organized HTML and CSS files for readability and maintainability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the webpage.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, including fonts, colors, and layout.

## üìÇ How to Run

Since this is a static website, you can run it locally right from your browser.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
    *(Or simply download the ZIP file)*

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3.  **Open the `index.html` file:**
    * Open `index.html` directly in your favorite web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
